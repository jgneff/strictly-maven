title: Strictly Maven
summary: Apache Mavenâ„¢ in a strictly-confined snap
description: |
  Apache Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java
  projects. Maven can also be used to build and manage projects
  written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. Maven projects
  are configured by a file with a Project Object Model (pom.xml).

  This package provides the latest release of Maven built directly
  from its source code on GitHub. If the OpenJDK Snap package is
  also installed, this package connects to it automatically for the
  location of its Java Development Kit.

  This Snap package is strictly confined, running in complete isolation
  with only limited access to your system. For important information
  about running Maven in a confined environment, see the README file
  for this package on GitHub:

  https://github.com/jgneff/strictly-maven

  This is a convenience binary of the Maven tool and not a release
  by the Apache Software Foundation. For official releases, see:

  https://maven.apache.org
